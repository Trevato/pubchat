Each conversation has an id which is used as a URL slug so other users can view conversations. There will be only 2 pages. The first is a home page that lists all conversations by their ID and a button that allows the user to create a new chat. The second is the conversation page where a user can submit a message and see the history of all messages sent. The backend will use supabase to store the conversations and the messages. There are two database tables. The tables are `conversations` and `messages`. The conversations table has the following columns (with their types): - id (UUID) - created_at (timestampz) The messages table has the following columns (with their types): - id (int8) - created_at (timestampz) - content (text) - conversation_id (uuid)\n\nYou will need some things to use supabase.
